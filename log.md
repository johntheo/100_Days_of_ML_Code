# 100 Days Of ML[LOG]

## Day 0 : Jul 06 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I saw the Siraj Youtube videos about the ML Journey and talk to  some friends about them.

**Thoughts** : This seems to be a good challenge to myself because I will improve my ML habilities and organize better my schedule to manage those 100 days

## Day 1 : Jul 07 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Starting the data preparation for Titanic Disaster Challenge on Kaggle. Didn't commint anything yet, just seeing some solutions and running some kernels to get familiar.

**Thoughts** : I didn`t enjoy so much the data preparation step, because sometimes it is more operational than intelectual

## Day 2 : Jul 08 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I continue on data preparation. Thinking about all the features involved in the problem. 

**Thoughts** : I found a 4 C's approach: Correcting, Completing, Creating, Converting. So I will use that in my data preparatiion. Few data data to correct. A considerable amount of data to complete(null values). I will create a new feature about family members using 2 other features and I will convert some data like AGE to classess.
